# RadiusGame

This is a small Mini Game.
You have 5 Levels: 
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard
- Impossible
- HACK

You need to try to click on the buttons before they reach the 
right side of the screen (You only have 5 Lifes)

After you died you will get a End Animation which will count
teh Score as Radius and calculate the surface area(A) and the
Volume(V) [I had a homework to create a Volume Calculater
so i did a whole Mini Game out of it lol]

(The Last Level "HACK" have own Screen Design and a special 
button ability)

(Levels change on Background Music Sound)

I hope you will enjoy this small Mini Game! :D
